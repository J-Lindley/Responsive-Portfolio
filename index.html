      <p>
        I spent much of my early career working for Wizards of the Coast and a few small gaming retailers. This gave me
        the opportunity to travel the world going to some of the biggest game convention and tournaments in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently participating in the University of Washington Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This camp teaches all
        phases of the mern method of web devolpment. I've worked on projects ranging from this profile page, to making
        my own word game, and other projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm looking forward to finding a position that utiltizes my new skils and challenges me to keep growing by
        learning new languages and coding methods.
